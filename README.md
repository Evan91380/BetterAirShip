# Q&A
## Can you play Proximity Chat (Crewlink) with it?
Yes, Crewlink supports Among Us Modifications

## Can you get banned for playing on public Servers?
At the current state of the game there is no perma ban system for the game. The mod is designed in a way, that it does not send prohibited server requests. You are also able to join your own custom server to be safe [(Impostor)](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)

## Do my friends need to install the mod to play it together?
Yes. Every player in the lobby must have the mod installed.
